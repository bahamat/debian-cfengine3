This is version of cfengine 3. Please read the documentation carefully
before installing it. This software is NOT a drop-in upgrade for
cfengine 2 installations. It is a significantly more powerful version
of cfengine which offers a path to upgrading gradually while
supporting an existing cfengine 2 base.

What is NOT included in this release:

 - packages
 - Filesystem ACL support
 - Interface management

These issues still require further research and will be included
in the next release.

Please see the INSTALL file for build instructions.
